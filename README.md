# **Task-Management-System**  
I built a **Task-Management-System** to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface to **add, edit, and delete tasks**, ensuring better productivity and organization.  
 
## **Features**  
 **Task Management** – Create, update, and delete tasks.  
 **Data Persistence** – Tasks are stored in MySQL for reliability.  
 **User-Friendly UI** – Clean and minimal interface for easy navigation.  

## **Challenges & Solutions**  
- **Optimizing database queries** → Used indexing and efficient query structuring for faster performance.  
- **Ensuring smooth API communication** → Implemented RESTful services with proper request handling.  
- **Managing state efficiently** → Used React’s state management and hooks for seamless UI updates.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
Add **user authentication** for personalized task lists.   
 Implement **task status tracking** (pending/completed).  
 Introduce **deadline reminders & notifications**.  
 Enhance UI with **drag-and-drop for task prioritization**.
